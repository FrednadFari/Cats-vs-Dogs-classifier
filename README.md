# Cats-vs-Dogs-classifier
A deep learning project using PyTorch & TensorFlow to classify cat vs. dog images

üîç Here‚Äôs a comparison based on your context (Cats vs. Dogs CNN):

Criteria	                TensorFlow	                               PyTorch
* Ease of Setup (Colab)	    ‚úÖ Built-in data pipeline                 Requires more manual setup
                           (image_dataset_from_directory)	
* Model Summary / Layers	  ‚úÖ Clear with .summary()	                 More verbose with print(model)
* Training Loop	            ‚úÖ High-level (model.fit())	               Manual training loop
* Built-in Augmentation	    ‚úÖ Easy with Sequential() layers	         Requires torchvision.transforms
* Saving/Loading	          ‚úÖ One-liner model.save()	                 Requires tracking both model and state_dict
* Binary Classification	    ‚úÖ Easier with                            Needs careful loss/function selection
                           sparse_categorical_crossentropy + Softmax	


üß† Verdict (for Binary Image Classification):
TensorFlow is often more convenient and faster to prototype, especially for binary classification using CNNs and working in Google Colab.
