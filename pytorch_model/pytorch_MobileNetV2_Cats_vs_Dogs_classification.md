ðŸ§µ PyTorch MobileNetV2 - Cats vs. Dogs Classification

This project implements transfer learning using MobileNetV2 in PyTorch for binary classification of cats and dogs. It also includes comparisons with the same architecture in TensorFlow and earlier CNN models built from scratch.

ðŸ“Š Model Overview

Architecture: Pretrained MobileNetV2 from torchvision.models

Modifications:

Replaced final classifier layer to output 1 logit (for binary classification)

Used BCEWithLogitsLoss with sigmoid activation

Fine-tuned final layers only (last stages of feature extractor)

ðŸ“ˆ Training Strategy

Image size: 128x128

Batch size: 32

Optimizer: Adam, LR: 1e-3

Scheduler: ReduceLROnPlateau (ideal for fewer epochs)

Data Augmentation: Applied via torchvision.transforms

RandomHorizontalFlip

RandomRotation

RandomResizedCrop
